* I have centered the heading in homepage and form without using position, instead using line-height and display.

### Unfixed bugs
* Because of using vh value, the website is more responsive in landscape mode on ipad and such devices. However, it is responsive on portrait for small devices.
* The navigation bar fades over the hero image and reappears after that section, because both have overflow:hidden; property, I have searched and couldn't find a good solution for that while maintaining the structure of the page.
